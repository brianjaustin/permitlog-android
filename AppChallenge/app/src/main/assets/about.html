    <h2>What is this app?</h2>
    <p>The Permit Log mobile app helps teen drivers with learner's permits accurately and easily record their driving hours. It keeps a running total of the number of hours driven and tracks all of the data required for a permit log. When the permit-holder completes all of their required hours, they can export them, either in a generic spreadsheet format or using the Maine-specific form, then print it out and send it to the DMV.</p>

    <h2>Why did we make this?</h2>
    <p>Every teen that wants to drive must fill out a permit log. Filling out a paper permit log, however, is not very efficient. A paper log can be easily lost, damaged, or forgotten. Other non-cloud based electronic methods aren't much better since data can be accidentally deleted and copying the hours by hand once you're done is a long and tedious process. This is the problem that Permit Log sets out to fix. Our app can automatically time your drives, syncs with the cloud as well as between phones, and can export your form automatically. All you have to do is print, sign, and mail it to the DMV.</p>
